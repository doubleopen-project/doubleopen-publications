# Contributing to Double Open publications

Please work on the dev branch and let us know of your plans.

Entry on 15-02-2019: We are looking to publish an updated version (v2) of our landscape survey in March 2019. For this we are looking for additions of new tools and better descriptions of existing tools and other work. If you promote a tool, or otherwise are willing to contribute, we welcome pull requests.
