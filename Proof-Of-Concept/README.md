# The Double Open Proof of Concept

Double Open project will provide two distinct proof of concepts. The first one is a toolchain proof of concept to automate open source compliance in Yocto and embedded linux. The second one is a competence development proof of concept, in which we will assess different skill sets required by different actors working with open source software regarding compliance.
